    <p></p>
    <p>Orwell's Rules</p>
    <ol>
      <li> Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.</li>
      <li> Never use a long word where a short one will do.</li>
      <li> If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.</li>
      <li> Never use the passive where you can use the active.</li>
      <li> Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.</li>
      <li> Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.</li>
    </ol>
